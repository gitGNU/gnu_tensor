This package  provides a library which is an extension for the
GNU Scientific Library (GSL). The latest version can be found at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tensor/

It allows to define and manipulate tensors, multidimensional arrays of
any order with the same dimension for every index. Tensors generalize
vectors and square matrices, and provide powerful functions like
tensorial product, index contraction and index swapping.

The library interface is very similar to that of gsl_matrix, and most
of the functions that exist for gsl_matrix are also implemented for
tensors and have the same syntax.

Its sister project is "marray", which defines a new type similar to tensor
but with the arbitrary dimension for each index (for matrices, that would
be rectangular matrices), but without the tensor operations defined. It is
suited to work with data grids. "marray" can be found at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/marray/

To install this software you first need the GNU Scientific Library
(GSL), that you can get from: http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/ . See the
detailed instructions in the file INSTALL in this same
directory. Briefly, all you need to do is:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
(for the last step you may need to be root).

If you took the files directly from the repository, you will need to
run ./autogen.sh first. That is:
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

To use this library, compile your program with
  gcc -o myprog -lgslcblas -lgsl -ltensor myprog.c

That's it. Have fun!
